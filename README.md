# UnoProLyzer
Oscilloscope application for the UnoProLogic2
EPT UnoProLogic USB-CPLD development system provides a flexible learning platform
by combining a powerful Complex Programmable Logic Device with  High Speed USB. 

It is designed to provide an innovative method of developing and debugging programmable logic code.
It also provides a high speed data transfer mechanism between any microcontroller (or any digital device) and a host PC.
The EPT USB-CPLD development system provides a convenient, user-friendly work flow by connecting seamlessly with
Alteraâ€™s Quartus II software. The user will develop the code in the Quartus environment on a Windows Personal Computer. 
The programmable logic code is then loaded into the CPLD using only the Quartus Programmer software and a standard USB cable.
The programmer hardware is built in to the UnoProLogic.
